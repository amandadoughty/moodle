All sections * except zero have a toggle that displays that section. One or more sections can be displayed at any given time. * Toggles are persistent on a per browser session per course basis but can be made to persist longer. * * @package    course/format * @subpackage culcourse * @version    See the value of '$plugin->version' in below. * @author     Amanda Doughty * @license    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU Public License * */defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();$capabilities = [    'format/cul:viewallphotoboard' => [        'captype' => 'write',        'contextlevel' => CONTEXT_COURSE,        'archetypes' => [            'editingteacher' => CAP_ALLOW,            'manager' => CAP_ALLOW        ]    ],    'format/cul:viewphotoboard' => [        'captype' => 'write',        'contextlevel' => CONTEXT_COURSE,        'archetypes' => [            'student' => CAP_ALLOW        ]    ]];
