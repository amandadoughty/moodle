About
=====

This is a peer grading based group assignment activity for Moodle 

This module enables a group of students submit one file as their
assignment. In addition to the file submission the students can rate 
their fellow group members activity on the project.
The activity then calculates the grade the students receive.
The teacher still has to apply the grade to the submission
The final grade is based on the teacher grade and the group grade.
