# mod_peerwork

About
=====

This is a peer work group assignment activity for Moodle.
This plugin addresses the issue of all students recieving the same grade for group assignments regardless of individual contribution.

Using this module:

Tutors create an activity defining peer grading criteria and weightings.
Tutors define number of files to be submitted allowing "0" for an offline activity.
Tutors control visibility / privacy for students in terms of peer scores, comments.
Students submit work (optional).
Students rate their peers for each criteria (required).
Students can leave feedback comments (optional). 
Teachers grade the group assignment.

The activity then calculates the grade each individual student receives.
The final individual grade is based on the teacher grade, peer ratings and weighting. 

Teachers can adjust weightings on a per group basis and override any individual grades they need to.
Teachers then release grades ensuring all students recieve their grades at the same time.
Teachers can export grades for an individual group or the entire cohort as a csv file.
